# ML-IntelliChurn
ML-Intelli-Churn is a full-stack, production-ready machine learning project designed to predict customer churn in the telecom sector. 
It demonstrates an end-to-end ML pipeline, including feature storage, model training, API deployment, and containerization, 
showcasing skills in modern ML engineering practices.

# Features / Highlights
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features.
- Feature Store: Using Feast to maintain consistent features for training and inference.
- Model Training: Scikit-learn / XGBoost with MLflow for logging and versioning.
- Model Registry: Track versions and mark “Production” models.
- Prediction API: FastAPI endpoint to receive input and return predictions.
- Containerization: Dockerized for easy deployment anywhere.
- Ready for Monitoring & Drift Detection (Evidently AI) and Automated Retraining (Airflow) for future upgrades.
